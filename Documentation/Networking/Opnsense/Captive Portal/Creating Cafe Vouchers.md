# Creating Vouchers for Captive Portal

## Prerequisites

Ensure that your captive portal is set up and ready to use. Follow the initial setup instructions if you haven't done so already.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accessing Voucher Services

1. **Navigate to Services > Captive Portal > Vouchers**:
   - Go to the Services menu in your network management interface.
   - Select Vouchers from the dropdown menu.

### Step 2: Creating a New Voucher

1. **Create a Voucher**:
   - Click on the "Create" button to generate a new voucher batch.

2. **Set Voucher Details**:
   - **Validity**: This determines the duration for which the user will have internet access after redeeming the voucher. Create different voucher batches for varying durations (e.g., a week, a month, a year). For this example, set it to **1 month**.
   - **Expires**: How much time the voucher can go idle unused.
   - **Number of Vouchers**: Enter the quantity of vouchers you want to create in this batch. For this example, set it to **25**.
   - **Name**: Give the voucher batch a descriptive name such as **Month Pass**.

3. **Generate the Vouchers**:
   - After filling in the required fields, click on the "Generate" or "Create" button.
   - You should receive a download of a CSV file containing the generated vouchers.

### Step 3: Handling the Vouchers

1. **Downloading the CSV File**:
   - Save the CSV file to your computer. This file contains a list of usernames and passwords for the vouchers.

2. **Parsing or Managing the Vouchers**:
   - Open the CSV file using a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
   - You can either parse this data programmatically or manually copy-paste the usernames and passwords into a Google Doc.

3. **Distributing the Vouchers**:
   - Print out the vouchers or distribute them electronically.
   - Ensure each voucher is given to a user once they have paid the required amount for internet access.

### Step 4: Creating Different Voucher Groups

1. **Creating Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly Vouchers**:
   - Repeat the process above to create different groups of vouchers for various time durations (e.g., week, month, year).
   - Name each batch accordingly (e.g., **Week Pass**, **Month Pass**, **Year Pass**).

2. **Differentiating Vouchers**:
   - Consider printing the vouchers on different colored paper or using different designs to distinguish between week, month, and year passes.

### Example: Creating a Month Pass

1. **Navigate to Services > Vouchers**:
   - Select Vouchers from the Services menu.
2. **Create a Voucher**:
   - Set **Validity** to 1 minute.
   - Set **Expires** to 1 month.
   - Set **Number of Vouchers** to 25.
   - Name it **Month Pass**.
3. **Generate the Vouchers**:
   - Click "Create" and download the CSV file.
4. **Distribute the Vouchers**:
   - Open the CSV file, copy the data into a Google Doc, and print or distribute as needed.

By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and distribute internet access vouchers for your captive portal system.
